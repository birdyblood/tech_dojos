>A code kata is an exercise in programming which helps programmers hone their skills through practice and repetition

Some of the advantages of practicing code katas:
* Practice TDD
* Learn and use new IDE tips and tricks
* Refactor mercilessly skills
* Give you a chance to mess around with new tech and languages
* Brain muscle flexing
* Selfish sense of accomplishment :)

To be effective, try to limit the number of people in a group :arrow_right: on a 10+ people group, not everybody will be able to participate, sad ! :lying_face:
